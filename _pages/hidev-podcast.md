Iâ€™m the host of HiDev Podcast. We talk (in portuguese) about a wide variety of topics related to software development and the career of profissionals from industry and academia. At some days in 2021, we have been the **Top #10 Most Listened Technology Podcast in Brazil according to Spotify**.

It is available on most of the main podcast aggregators/apps. Check it <a href="https://anchor.fm/hidevpodcast" target="_blank">HERE</a>
